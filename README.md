## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
 I fight a little bit trying to be as semantic as possible, i think there's no just one way to see the semantic, but a lot of ways to organize the same content in a meaningful way. Also, i have to grab some paper and a pen to draw some sketches and explain to myself different ways to write the code, making me think far away from my initial thoughts. In general, this was a simple project, but made me spend a whole hour thinking the semantic. Maybe due to the short amount of code lines that requires, semantic doesn't have too much weight, but i still think that even simple projects should have a semantic HTML code :)

### Continued development

I want to add more interactivity in the future. That the user have the possibility to switch to the back side of the card, maybe a couple css effects to start learning and practicing animations.

## Acknowledgments

Working in this project was fun. I don't think it's the best solution yet, but in the future i'll watch this and improving using the knowledge i got from the past projects. Thanks to Frontend Mentor for this project ideas, really fun, and a huge tool to the people that often doesn't know what to code to practice like me haha.
